# git-along

Basic concept: creates raw branches for specific files in your repo, so that you can use them
* without polluting the repo
* and let them evolve separately from the code.

Documentation to follow.

# Future work

* Auto gitignore
* Branching from stash branches
* Figure out what to call "stash branches"
* Streamline stash branch setup
* Add files to branches
* Rely on branch contents instead of configs
